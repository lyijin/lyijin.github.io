          <h1>Role of epigenetics</h1>
          <p>Epigenetics--modifications of the DNA that do not change the underlying sequence--can bring about phenotypic changes.
          <br /><br />
          In my postdoctoral work, I studied how DNA methylation helped corals acclimatise to the rapidly changing environment, and I also showed that these patterns can be transmitted intergenerationally (across a single generation).
          <br /><br />
          My work at CSIRO has mostly revolved around biomarker discovery in the cancer space. I have identified and designed assays for DNA methylation markers that are enriched in several cancers, e.g., the big four (breast, lung, prostate, colorectal) and oesophagus. I helmed a project that tried to develop a pan-animal epigenetic clock, but sadly invertebrate methylation patterns... are weird. I contribute to projects using other 'omics tech but anything DNA methylation occupies the space closest to my heart.</p>

          <h1>Blending wet & dry</h1>
          <p>Due to my training, my expertise lies somewhere in the intersection between molecular biology and bioinformatics. Glad to see more and more scientists are able to do both--I honestly believe that it's much easier spotting quirks in the data when one is more familiar with how the data is generated in the lab!
          <br /><br />
          I am interested in finding better ways to analyse the immense amounts of data generated by my lab. Knowing how to carry out the analyses is important, but so is couching the discoveries in biological terms. What does the data say? Why is it biologically significant? etc.</p>

          <h1>Prettifying data</h1>
          <p>Besides having an odd satisfaction over computing precise <em>p</em> values, and incomprehensible delight over pretty graphs (bonus points if the errors were estimated correctly!), I strive to be better at communicating my science to others. This also ties into my passion for science outreach--whilst the pay ain't great, it's (mostly) fun!
          <br /><br />
          I'm always looking for better ways to plot cleaner and more informative graphs, sprinkle an abstruse word or two in my writing to disguise my science as something more interesting than it actually is, and also express ideas in simpler terms to make my figures/talks more appealing to a diverse audience!</p>
