          <h1>Role of epigenetics</h1>
          <p>Epigenetics--modifications of the DNA that do not change the underlying sequence--can bring about phenotypic changes. In my postdoctoral work, I studied how DNA methylation helped corals acclimatise to the rapidly changing environment, especially pCO<sub>2</sub> stress; I also showed that these patterns can be transmitted intergenerationally (across a single generation).
          <br /><br />
          As part of the Diagnostics team at CSIRO, my focus have mostly shifted back to humans. I am involved in mining public data for potential biomarkers of health and wellbeing. There is a slim chance that my work could branch back to marine organisms... we'll see!</p>

          <h1>Blending wet & dry</h1>
          <p>Due to my training, my expertise lies somewhere in the intersection between molecular biology and bioinformatics. While it's a cool way to impress specialists on either side with my other side, being jack of all trades might mean that I'm master of none!
          <br /><br />
          I am interested in finding better ways to analyse the immense amounts of data generated by my lab. Knowing how to carry out the analyses is important, but so is couching the discoveries in biological terms. What does the data say? Why is it biologically significant? etc.</p>

          <h1>Prettifying data</h1>
          <p>Besides having an odd satisfaction over computing precise <em>p</em> values, and incomprehensible delight over pretty graphs (bonus points if the errors were estimated correctly!), I strive to be better at communicating my science to others.
          <br /><br />
          This includes understanding how to plot cleaner and more informative graphs, mastering the art of sprinkling an abstruse word or two in my writing to disguise my science as something more interesting than it actually is, and also finding ways to express ideas in simpler terms to make my talks more appealing to a diverse audience!</p>
